	title={Graph Neural Networks for Charged Particle Tracking on FPGAs},
	abstract={The determination of charged particle trajectories in collisions at the CERN
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is an important but challenging problem, especially
in the high interaction density conditions expected during the future
high-luminosity phase of the LHC (HL-LHC). Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a
type of geometric deep learning algorithm that has successfully been applied to
this task by embedding tracker data as a graph -- nodes represent hits, while
edges represent possible track segments -- and classifying the edges as true or
fake track segments. However, their study in hardware- or software-based
trigger applications has been limited due to their large computational cost. In
this paper, we introduce an automated translation workflow, integrated into a
broader tool called $\texttt{hls4ml}$, for converting GNNs into firmware for
field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). We use this translation tool to
implement GNNs for charged particle tracking, trained using the TrackML
challenge dataset, on FPGAs with designs targeting different graph sizes, task
complexites, and latency/throughput requirements. This work could enable the
inclusion of charged particle tracking GNNs at the trigger level for HL-LHC
experiments.},

	abstract={We investigate the performance of a jet identification algorithm based on interaction networks (JEDI-net) to identify all-hadronic decays of high-momentum heavy particles produced at the LHC and distinguish them from ordinary jets originating from the hadronization of quarks and gluons. The jet dynamics are described as a set of one-to-one interactions between the jet constituents. Based on a representation learned from these interactions, the jet is associated to one of the considered categories. Unlike other architectures, the JEDI-net models achieve their performance without special handling of the sparse input jet representation, extensive pre-processing, particle ordering, or specific assumptions regarding the underlying detector geometry. The presented models give better results with less model parameters, offering interesting prospects for LHC applications.},

energy-efficient devices and systems are extremely valuable across a broad

an open-source software-hardware codesign workflow to interpret and translate
machine learning algorithms for implementation with both FPGA and ASIC
technologies. We expand on previous hls4ml work by extending capabilities and
techniques towards low-power implementations and increased usability: new
Python APIs, quantization-aware pruning, end-to-end FPGA workflows, long
pipeline kernels for low power, and new device backends include an ASIC
workflow. Taken together, these and continued efforts in hls4ml will arm a new
generation of domain scientists with accessible, efficient, and powerful tools

	abstract={We compare the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on jet images with dense neural networks (DNNs) trained on nn-subjettiness variables to study the distinguishing power of these two separate techniques applied to top quark decays. We find that they perform almost identically and are highly correlated once jet mass information is included, which suggests they are accessing the same underlying information which can be intuitively understood as being contained in 4-, 5-, 6-, and 8-body kinematic phase spaces depending on the sample. This suggests both of these methods are highly useful for heavy object tagging and provides a tentative answer to the question of what the image network is actually learning.},

bstract
Building on the notion of a particle physics detector as a camera and the collimated streams of high energy particles, or jets, it measures as an image, we investigate the potential of machine learning techniques based on deep learning architectures to identify highly boosted
W
bosons. Modern deep learning algorithms trained on
jet images
can out-perform standard physically-motivated feature driven approaches to jet tagging. We develop techniques for visualizing how these features are learned by the network and what additional information is used to improve performance. This interplay between physicallymotivated feature driven tools and supervised learning algorithms is general and can be used to significantly increase the sensitivity to discover new particles and new forces, and gain a deeper understanding of the physics within jets.},

bstract
We introduce a novel approach to jet tagging and classification through the use of techniques inspired by computer vision. Drawing parallels to the problem of facial recognition in images, we define a
jet-image
using calorimeter towers as the elements of the image and establish jet-image preprocessing methods. For the jet-image processing step, we develop a discriminant for classifying the jet-images derived using Fisher discriminant analysis. The effectiveness of the technique is shown within the context of identifying boosted hadronic
W
boson decays with respect to a background of quark- and gluoninitiated jets. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we demonstrate that the performance of this technique introduces additional discriminating power over other substructure approaches, and gives significant insight into the internal structure of jets.},

	abstract={A wide range of gas mixtures is used for the operation of different gaseous detectors at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments. Nowadays some of these gases, as C2H2F4, CF4 and SF6, are indicated as greenhouse gases (GHG) and dominate the overall GHG emission from particle detectors at the LHC experiments. The release of GHG is an important subject for the design of future particle detectors as well as for the operation of the current experiments. Different strategies have been adopted at CERN for reducing the GHG emissions. The standard approach is the recirculation of the gas mixture with complex gas systems where system stability and the possible accumulation of impurities need to be attentively evaluated for the good operation and safety of the detectors. A second approach is based on the recuperation of the gas mixture exiting the detectors and the separation of its gas components for re-use. At long-term, the use of less invasive gases is being investigated, especially for the Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) systems. Operation of RPC with environmentally friendly gas mixtures is demonstrated for streamer mode while avalanche mode operation needs more complex gas mixtures.},
