\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}
Physics experiments are crucial
Big data is crucial for Physics
LHC is currently bottleneck at real time speed for detectors
Transformer Neural Networks are great

Powerful hardware is king
FPGA are great for NN
Metaprogramming allows for optimizations and customisability

\section{Objectives and Challenges}
Current architecture at LHC is too slow -> make it quick enough for real time processing
HLS is difficult, so coding hardware in Python is desired -> make it easy for engineers and physicists to design systems
FPGA are very hard-coded -> make the code deployable on any platform with optimal settings automatically
